About
-----
Potential friend finder is a demo app for a simple version of the _People You May Know Algorithm_ used on [Gowalla](http://gowalla.com). You can check out the real-algorithm in-action on the web by signing up for a [Gowalla](http://gowalla.com) account and adding friends. For more information please check out the source code, and i'll post a link to the slides that discuss this code in the future. 

Please fork this project, and see if you can come up with improvements to the algorithm. If you want me to pull your fork later, please make your changes on a branch, and give the user some way to toggle between your algorithm and the original algorithm.

If you want to contribute and you need to reach me, you can find me on the twitters @schneems
